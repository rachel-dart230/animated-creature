        <h1>Tin Man Monster!!!</h1>
        <p>
        As I started to create this creature, it began to somewhat resemble a tin man. This is because of the blocky body and the triangle hat placed on top. He is grey in color just like a man made of tin. For animation I added a sun in the back that is setting. For the background I aimed to create a blue sky with green grass.
